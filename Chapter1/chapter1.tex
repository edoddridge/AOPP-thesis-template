\newpage
\section{An amazing revelation}
It's so interesting, that we need to display a separate page.

\subsection{More details}
Some things deserve their own subsection - this is one of those things. More details can be found in Appendix \ref{app:example}.

\subsubsection{Nesting sections is fun}
Will this one get listed in the table of contents? It's up to you! 

Equations, like this one,

\begin{equation}
a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}
\end{equation}


 are numbered only to the chapter level by default.
