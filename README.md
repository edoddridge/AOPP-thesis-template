This repo contains a prototype thesis and all the files needed to create it.

The oxfordthesis class has been derived from the [ociamthesis class](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/it/faqs/latex/thesis-class) developed by K. A. Gillow.

Changes include:

* A fancy header on text pages;
* Using the book class as the base of the definition;
* Alterations to the layout of the title page;
* Inclusion of a number of useful macros; and
* Inclusion of the hyperref package to turn references in the PDF into links.
